# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Master simulation environments for testing and developing robot systems before deploying to physical hardware.

## Module Overview

Simulation is critical for robotics development - it's faster, safer, and cheaper than testing on real robots. Learn to create digital twins of robots and environments using industry-standard tools.

### What You'll Learn

**Week 6: Gazebo Basics & Physics Simulation**
- Introduction to Gazebo simulator
- URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Physics engines and collision detection
- Sensor simulation (cameras, LiDAR, IMU)
- Integrating Gazebo with ROS 2

**Week 7: Unity for Robotics & Visual Simulation**
- Unity for robot simulation
- High-fidelity graphics and rendering
- Sensor simulation in Unity
- Unity-ROS 2 integration
- Comparing Gazebo vs Unity use cases

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- ✅ Create robot models using URDF
- ✅ Simulate robots in Gazebo with accurate physics
- ✅ Build custom simulation environments
- ✅ Use Unity for visual and sensor simulation
- ✅ Choose the right simulator for your use case

## Hands-On Projects

- Build a custom robot model in URDF
- Simulate sensor data (camera, LiDAR)
- Create a virtual environment for testing

## Assessment

**Project: Gazebo Simulation**
- Design a robot model with sensors
- Create a custom simulation environment
- Demonstrate sensor data collection and robot control

## Tools & Resources

- Gazebo (latest version compatible with ROS 2 Humble)
- Unity 2022 LTS
- URDF/SDF modeling tools
- Blender (for 3D model creation)
