# Chapter 4: Vision-Language-Action Models & Capstone

**Weeks 11-13**

## Overview

This module explores Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and their application in humanoid robotics. You'll learn how to integrate multimodal AI systems with physical robots to enable intelligent, adaptive behavior. The module culminates in a capstone project where you'll build an end-to-end robotic system.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand the architecture and principles of Vision-Language-Action models
- Integrate VLA models with robotic control systems
- Process visual and linguistic inputs for robot decision-making
- Design and implement action primitives for humanoid robots
- Develop a complete robotic application from sensing to actuation
- Evaluate and optimize multimodal AI systems for real-time robotics
