# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Learn the foundations of robot communication and control using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2).

## Module Overview

ROS 2 is the backbone of modern robotics, providing the communication infrastructure that connects sensors, actuators, and AI algorithms. Think of it as the "nervous system" of a robot.

### What You'll Learn

**Week 3: ROS 2 Architecture & Basics**
- ROS 2 concepts: nodes, topics, services, actions
- Setting up ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04
- Creating your first ROS 2 node
- Understanding the publish-subscribe pattern

**Week 4: Nodes, Topics, and Communication**
- Publishing and subscribing to topics
- Custom message types
- Service client/server patterns
- Quality of Service (QoS) settings

**Week 5: Packages and Launch Files**
- Creating ROS 2 packages
- Launch file configuration
- Parameter management
- Building and running ROS 2 applications

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- ✅ Install and configure ROS 2 Humble
- ✅ Create ROS 2 nodes in Python
- ✅ Implement publish-subscribe communication
- ✅ Build custom ROS 2 packages
- ✅ Use launch files for complex robot systems

## Hands-On Projects

- Build a simple publisher-subscriber system
- Create a service for robot control
- Package a complete ROS 2 application

## Assessment

**Project: ROS 2 Package Development**
- Design and implement a multi-node ROS 2 system
- Demonstrate communication between nodes
- Document your package with README and launch files
