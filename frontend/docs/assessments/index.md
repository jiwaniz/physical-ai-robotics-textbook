## Submission Guidelines

### Code Submissions

All code must:
- Follow language-specific style guides (PEP 8 for Python, Google C++ for C++)
- Include README with setup instructions
- Pass automated linting checks
- Include unit tests where applicable

### Video Demonstrations

All demo videos must:
- Be 3-5 minutes in length
- Show full workflow from start to finish
- Include audio commentary explaining your approach
- Demonstrate error handling and edge cases

### Written Reports

All reports must:
- Use provided LaTeX or Markdown templates
- Include proper citations for external resources
- Explain design decisions and trade-offs
- Provide quantitative performance metrics

## Late Submission Policy

- **0-24 hours late**: 10% penalty
- **24-48 hours late**: 25% penalty
- **48-72 hours late**: 50% penalty
- **>72 hours late**: Not accepted (contact instructor for special circumstances)

## Academic Integrity

- You may discuss concepts with peers, but all code must be your own
- Cite all external resources and libraries used
- Do not share solutions or complete code with other students
- Plagiarism will result in zero credit and potential course failure

## Getting Help

If you're struggling with an assessment:

1. **Use the RAG chatbot** in the textbook for quick questions
2. **Attend office hours** for personalized guidance
3. **Post in discussion forums** for peer support
4. **Request extension** if facing legitimate hardship (must request before due date)

## Regrade Requests

If you believe your work was graded incorrectly:

1. Wait 24 hours after receiving grade
2. Review rubric and feedback carefully
3. Submit regrade request via course platform within 7 days
4. Include specific justification for each point disputed
